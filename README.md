# ðŸŽ“ Immutable Grade Ledger for Verified Credentials

> A blockchain-powered system for **transparent, tamper-proof academic credential storage** â€” built on Solidity and deployed on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Description

**Immutable Grade Ledger** is a decentralized smart contract that allows educational institutions to **record, verify, and publish student grades** in an immutable and transparent way.

Once a grade is entered, it **cannot be altered or deleted**, ensuring complete trust and authenticity in academic records.  
This project is ideal for learning **Solidity**, **smart contract deployment**, and **blockchain-based credential verification**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Lets an **authorized admin (institution)** add student grades to the blockchain.  
- Grades are **publicly viewable** but **not modifiable** by anyone.  
- Each record includes a student's name, course name, and marks.  
- Provides a **transparent ledger** of verified academic results.

## âœ¨ Features

âœ… **Immutable Records** â€“ Once a grade is added, it can never be changed or removed.  
âœ… **Admin-Only Access** â€“ Only the contract deployer (institution) can add grades.  
âœ… **Public Verification** â€“ Anyone can view a studentâ€™s grade using their unique ID.  
âœ… **Lightweight and Gas Efficient** â€“ Uses minimal data types for cheaper transactions.  
âœ… **Event Logging** â€“ Every grade addition is logged for transparency and easy tracking.
